# Py-Password-Security-and-Access-Key

This project displays a password strength checker when creating an account, and a method that will provide escalated access to a system depending on if an access key (hypothetically stored in a different system or only physically) is provided. The code itself will also hide the grantable password so the surface area for an attack is reduced.
